synopsis: Re-export client authentication primitives from `servant-client`
packages: servant-client-core, servant-client
prs: #1835
issues: #1834
description: {
Add `AuthClientData`, `AuthenticatedRequest`, and `mkAuthenticatedRequest` to the `Servant.Client.Core.Reexport` module, which is re-exported within `servant-client`.

This means that authenticated client requests can now be made using `servant-client` only, without an explicit dependency on `servant-client-core`.
}
